# Enigma Machine Encryption

This project implements a simple Enigma machine in Python to encrypt and decrypt messages. The Enigma machine was a mechanical encryption device used during World War II to secure German communications. It became famous for being broken by British cryptanalysts, including Alan Turing.

## Features

- Encryption and decryption of messages using the Enigma machine.
- Ability to customize the configuration of the Enigma machine by modifying the rotors and reflectors.
- Random generation of initial rotor positions for enhanced security.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source files.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python3 enigma.py
```

## Usage

Run the `enigma.py` script and follow the instructions to enter the message to encrypt.
The encrypted message will be displayed on the screen.

## Custom Configuration

You can customize the configuration of the Enigma machine by modifying the rotors and reflectors in the `enigma.py` script. Refer to the "Usage Example" section in the script to understand how to configure the machine with your own settings.
